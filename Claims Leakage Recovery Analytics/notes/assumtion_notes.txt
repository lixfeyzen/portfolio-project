Analytical Assumptions Summary

1. Dataset Scope
- Analysis based on publicly available motor insurance claims dataset (Mendeley).
- No health insurance claims included.

2. Policy Coverage Encoding
- policy_csl stored as categorical ranges (e.g., 250/500).
- Coverage indicator treated as risk signal, not confirmed breach.

3. Leakage Detection Philosophy
- Conservative rule-based approach applied.
- Objective: minimize false positives rather than maximize findings.

4. Result Interpretation
- Zero detected leakage interpreted as effective control under current rules.
- Absence of leakage does not imply absence of risk.
