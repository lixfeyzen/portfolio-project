PHASE 4 — SQL EXECUTION LOG
Claims Leakage & Recovery Analytics

Execution Context

Project       : Claims Leakage & Recovery Analytics
Phase         : Phase 4 – SQL Analysis & Business Logic
Database      : DuckDB (persistent file)
DB File       : db/claims_leakage.duckdb
Execution     : Python REPL (CMD)
OS            : Windows

Data Load
---------
Source File   : data/insurance_claims.csv
Load Method   : read_csv_auto()
Table Created : insurance_claims
Load Status   : SUCCESS

Record Count
------------
Total Claims  : 1000 records

Validation Results
------------------
Total Claims Paid (SUM total_claim_amount)
- Value        : 52,761,940

Component Reconciliation Check
- total_claim_amount vs (injury + property + vehicle)
- Mismatch Count : 0
- Status         : No component reconciliation issues detected

Data Quality Findings
---------------------
Field          : policy_csl
Data Type      : VARCHAR
Observed Values:
- '100/300'
- '250/500'
- '500/1000'

Impact:
- policy_csl cannot be directly compared with numeric claim amounts
- Coverage limits are encoded as text ranges
- Explicit parsing logic is required before coverage breach analysis

Notes

- This data structure reflects realistic insurance policy representations
- Coverage limit parsing will be handled in subsequent business rule implementation
- No raw financial values were modified during validation
- All findings are based on executed SQL queries

Status

Phase 4.2 (Data Validation) : COMPLETED
Next Step                  : Parse policy_csl into numeric coverage limit


Coverage Breach Interpretation Note
-----------------------------------
Observation:
- 999 out of 1000 claims exceed parsed policy CSL limits

Assessment:
- Policy CSL values appear to represent categorical coverage levels,
  not monetary limits comparable to claim amounts

Decision:
- Coverage breach retained as risk indicator only
- Coverage limits excluded from direct leakage amount calculation
- Leakage estimation will rely on cost–severity reasonableness rules

Rationale:
- Prevents systematic overstatement of leakage
- Aligns analysis with realistic insurance data constraints


Leakage Calculation Outcome
---------------------------
Result:
- No claims met the severity–cost mismatch criteria
- Potential leakage amount calculated as zero

Interpretation:
- Dataset does not exhibit cost anomalies relative to severity classification
- Severity labels may be too coarse for leakage detection
- Data appears more suitable for fraud classification than operational leakage

Conclusion:
- Leakage not detected under conservative, defensible rules
- Result reflects data limitations, not execution failure
